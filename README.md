`colour.js` is a library for Javascript that hopes to provides easy support / operations 
on hex colours.

The project, in its current state is a very small fraction of what I'm hoping to build 
overtime. There are probably many (MUCH better) libraries out there doing what I'm hoping 
to do. I just thought building my own library might teach me a lot in the process, hence 
I decided to go down this route.

Please feel free to add any ideas (PR's are even better) for improvement.

For examples: checkout `samples.html`
